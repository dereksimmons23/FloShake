# FloShake: Transforming Knowledge Work

FloShake is an intelligence-augmented creativity framework that reimagines how humans interact with information. By blending human wisdom with AI, FloShake enhances creative flow and reveals hidden connections across knowledge assets.

## Core Concepts

### Quantum State Content Model
Content exists simultaneously across four fundamental states:
- **Creation Space**: Nascent ideas in formative development
- **Integration Space**: Connections forming between discrete elements
- **Application Space**: Practical implementation of synthesized concepts
- **Foundation Space**: Established knowledge serving as building blocks

### Flow Protection Framework
ML-driven detection and protection of deep creative states through:
- Flow state detection across continuous spectrum (0-100)
- Contextual interruption impact analysis
- Priority-based notification orchestration
- Learning from personal work patterns

### Serendipity Engine
Pattern recognition to discover non-obvious relationships through:
- Multi-dimensional pattern analysis
- Relationship strength assessment
- Interactive visualization with exploration
- Learning-enhanced recommendation

### Agentic RAG Integration
Enhanced intelligence through specialized agents mapped to quantum states:
- Document agents for state-specific content understanding
- Meta-agent for cross-state orchestration
- Flow-aware knowledge delivery
- Context preservation through Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Current Development Phase

FloShake is currently in active development, with documentation and conceptual frameworks being established. This repository serves as a reference implementation of the quantum state model.

The project will be open for contributions after the initial framework is completed. Please check back soon for contribution guidelines.
