# FloShake: Technology That Frees Us From Technology

FloShake is an intelligence-augmented creativity framework that reimagines how humans interact with information. By blending human wisdom with AI, FloShake enhances creative flow, reveals hidden connections, and helps you get through digital work faster so you can get back to real life.

## Core Concepts

### Quantum State Content Model
Content exists simultaneously across four fundamental states, mirroring how humans naturally think and converse:
- **Creation Space**: Nascent ideas in formative development
- **Integration Space**: Connections forming between discrete elements
- **Application Space**: Practical implementation of synthesized concepts
- **Foundation Space**: Established knowledge serving as building blocks

### Flow Protection Framework
ML-driven detection and protection of deep creative states to preserve precious moments of immersion:
- Flow state detection across continuous spectrum (0-100)
- Contextual interruption impact analysis
- Priority-based notification orchestration
- Learning from personal work patterns

### Serendipity Engine
Pattern recognition to discover non-obvious relationships in an increasingly siloed information landscape:
- Multi-dimensional pattern analysis
- Relationship strength assessment
- Interactive visualization with exploration
- Learning-enhanced recommendation

### Agentic RAG Integration
Enhanced intelligence through specialized agents mapped to quantum states:
- Document agents for state-specific content understanding
- Meta-agent for cross-state orchestration
- Flow-aware knowledge delivery
- Context preservation through Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### Our Purpose

In a world experiencing a loneliness epidemic and increasing digital overwhelm, FloShake aims to be technology that knows when to get out of the way. Our mission is to help people get through digital work faster so they can return to the richness of the analog world - lying in grass, taking family vacations, attending live shows, or simply being present at the dinner table.

We believe the most successful technology isn't what captures more of your attention, but what accomplishes your digital tasks so efficiently that you can disconnect and reconnect with what matters most.

## Implementation Status

FloShake is currently in Week 2 of implementation:
- ‚úÖ Week 1: Technical Foundation and Core Structure (Completed)
- üîÑ Week 2: Framework Documentation and Agentic RAG Integration (In Progress)
- ‚è≥ Week 3: Interactive Demonstrations and Prototypes (Upcoming)

Follow our [development log](/blog/) for regular updates on implementation progress.

## Economic Model Innovation

FloShake challenges conventional digital economic models:

- **Value Return**: Instead of extracting value from users through subscriptions, FloShake explores ways to return value to the people who create and consume content
- **Accessibility**: If AI will eliminate jobs, we need solutions for basic income and universal accessibility to digital tools
- **Funding Model**: Rather than burdening users with subscription costs, we envision a model where advertisers, sponsors, partners, and giant tech companies fund access
