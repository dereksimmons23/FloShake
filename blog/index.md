# FloShake Development Log

Follow our journey as we build FloShake - the intelligence-augmented creativity framework that's transforming knowledge work.

## Latest Updates

### March 27, 2025: Quantum State Implementation

Today marks a significant milestone as we've completed the core implementation of the quantum state model. The FloShake site now features a directory structure that mirrors our conceptual framework, with content existing across Creation, Integration, Application, and Foundation states.

Key accomplishments:
- Implemented state-specific directories and layout templates
- Created visual state indicators with transition paths
- Developed CSS framework for state visualization
- Established flow session documentation framework

We've also begun integrating Agentic RAG concepts into the FloShake architecture, with document agents mapped to quantum states and a meta-agent for orchestration. This enhancement will be a primary focus for Week 2 implementation.

### March 26, 2025: First Public Deployment

Today marks a significant milestone in the FloShake journey as we launch our public website and documentation framework. This deployment represents the transition from theoretical concept to tangible implementation.

#### From Quantum Kitchen to FloShake

Originally conceived as "Quantum Kitchen," this project has evolved into FloShakeâ€”a framework that more precisely articulates our mission of blending human wisdom with AI to enhance creative flow. The name embodies our core philosophy: combining the right ingredients to achieve optimal results through the integration of human insight and artificial intelligence.

#### Implementation Progress

The current deployment includes:
- Core conceptual framework documentation
- Initial system architecture specifications
- Development roadmap and milestone tracking
- Foundational technical specifications

### March 25, 2025: Project Inception

Today marks the official beginning of the FloShake implementation journey. After months of conceptual development under the project name "Quantum Kitchen," we're moving forward with a focused implementation strategy.

Key initial steps:
- Established GitHub repository structure
- Created information architecture for documentation
- Developed initial content framework
- Configured domain and technical foundation

## Week 2 Plans

Our Week 2 implementation will focus on:

1. **Framework Documentation Enhancement**
   - Agentic RAG integration with quantum states
   - Model Context Protocol (MCP) for context preservation
   - Architecture diagrams showing component relationships

2. **Visual Design Implementation**
   - Navigation structure improvement
   - Dashboard-style homepage with card-based layout
   - CSS enhancement for consistent visual identity

3. **Interactive Prototypes**
   - Quantum state visualization
   - Flow protection demonstration
   - Agent interaction prototype

Stay tuned for regular updates as we bring this transformative framework to life.
