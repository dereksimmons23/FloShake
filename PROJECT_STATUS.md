   - Implement progressive disclosure for complex topics

3. **CSS Enhancement**
   - Apply refined color system consistently
   - Improve typography and spacing
   - Implement card and grid components

### Days 5-7: Interactive Prototypes

1. **Quantum State Visualization**
   - Create simple interactive diagram showing state transitions
   - Visualize how content exists across multiple states
   - Show how Agentic RAG agents interact with states

2. **Flow Protection Demonstration**
