## Model Context Protocol Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a framework for preserving and enhancing contextual awareness across state transitions in FloShake. This protocol defines how contextual information is maintained, transferred, and enhanced as content evolves through quantum states.

> **Note**: The Model Context Protocol is currently in the Creation state and will be expanded with detailed implementation specifications in upcoming releases.

## Core Concepts

### Context Preservation

MCP ensures that critical context is maintained as content transitions between quantum states, preserving:

- Flow state information
- Relationship mappings
- Creation intent
- Historical transitions

### Contextual Awareness

The protocol enhances awareness across state boundaries through:

- Cross-state context sharing
- Meta-agent orchestrated context synthesis
- Progressive context refinement
- Temporal context preservation

### Context-Driven Intelligence

MCP enables more sophisticated intelligence through:

- Expanded context windows for pattern recognition
- Context-aware relationship discovery
- History-informed transition recommendations
- Meta-context synthesis for serendipitous connections

## Integration with Agentic RAG

The Model Context Protocol serves as a critical enhancement to the Agentic RAG framework, providing standardized mechanisms for context preservation and exchange between document agents and the meta-agent.

## Coming Soon

The full implementation details of the Model Context Protocol are currently under development. This documentation will be expanded as the protocol evolves from Creation to Integration state.
