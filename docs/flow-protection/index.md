# Flow Protection Core

The Flow Protection Core represents the foundational intelligence system within FloShake, designed to detect, protect, and enhance deep creative states through machine learning-driven pattern recognition. This system fundamentally reimagines interruption management through contextual awareness and predictive modeling.

## Flow State Intelligence Model

Flow states exist across a continuous spectrum with distinct phases:
- **Preparation Phase** (0-30 score): Warming up, gathering resources, initial focus
- **Entry Phase** (31-60 score): Building momentum, narrowing attention
- **Engagement Phase** (61-80 score): Deep focus, productive creation
- **Deep Phase** (81-100 score): Optimal performance, immersive creation

Flow moves fluidly between states through:
- **Positive Transitions**: Deeper engagement through momentum building
- **Negative Transitions**: State degradation through interruptions
- **Recovery Transitions**: Flow rebuilding after interruptions
- **Session Evolution**: Natural energy patterns across work sessions

## Interruption Impact Framework

Interruptions affect flow states with variable impact based on:
- **Interruption Type**: Notifications, context switches, environmental factors
- **Current Flow Depth**: Deeper states experience more significant impact
- **Timing Dynamics**: Interruptions later in flow have greater impact
- **Content Context**: Interruptions related to current work have lower impact
