# FloShake Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for FloShake - the intelligence-augmented creativity framework blending human wisdom with AI to enhance creative flow.

## Framework Components

### [Flow Protection Core](/docs/flow-protection/)

The Flow Protection Core represents the foundational intelligence system within FloShake, designed to detect, protect, and enhance deep creative states through machine learning-driven pattern recognition.

- [Flow State Intelligence Model](/docs/flow-protection/intelligence-model/)
- [ML Architecture](/docs/flow-protection/ml-architecture/)
- [Implementation Framework](/docs/flow-protection/implementation/)
- [Integration Architecture](/docs/flow-protection/integration/)

### [Quantum State Model](/docs/quantum-states/)

The Quantum State Model enables content to exist simultaneously across multiple states, creating a dynamic, evolving knowledge ecosystem.

- [State Architecture](/docs/quantum-states/architecture/)
- [Transition Intelligence](/docs/quantum-states/transitions/)
- [Persistence Framework](/docs/quantum-states/persistence/)
- [State Visualization](/docs/quantum-states/visualization/)

### [Serendipity Engine](/docs/serendipity/)

The Serendipity Engine reveals non-obvious connections across content through advanced pattern recognition.

- [Pattern Recognition Framework](/docs/serendipity/patterns/)
- [Relationship Mapping](/docs/serendipity/relationships/)
- [Insight Generation](/docs/serendipity/insights/)
- [Learning Architecture](/docs/serendipity/learning/)

### [Integration Framework](/docs/integration/)

The Integration Framework enables FloShake capabilities to extend across systems and workflows.

- [API Documentation](/docs/integration/api/)
- [Event System](/docs/integration/events/)
- [Extension Capabilities](/docs/integration/extensions/)
- [Implementation Examples](/docs/integration/examples/)
