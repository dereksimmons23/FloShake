# Integration Framework

The Integration Framework enables FloShake capabilities to extend across systems and workflows, creating a comprehensive intelligence-augmented ecosystem.

## API Architecture

The system provides programmatic access through:

- **State Management API**: Control and query content quantum states
- **Flow Protection API**: Integrate flow state intelligence
- **Pattern Recognition API**: Access relationship and pattern insights
- **Event System API**: Subscribe to and publish system events

## Event System

Component communication occurs through:

- **Event Emission**: Publishing state changes and insights
- **Event Subscription**: Receiving notifications of relevant changes
- **Event Transformation**: Processing event implications
- **Event History**: Learning from historical patterns

## Extension Capabilities

The system supports capability extension through:

- **Plugin Architecture**: Custom components for specialized functionality
- **Integration Connectors**: Pre-built connections to common systems
- **Custom Visualizations**: Specialized insight representations
- **Domain-Specific Patterns**: Industry and context-specific recognition models
