# Quantum State Model

The Quantum State Model represents the core architectural principle of FloShake, enabling content to exist simultaneously across multiple states with intelligence-augmented transition pathways.

## Core States

Content exists simultaneously across four fundamental states:

- **Creation Space**: Nascent ideas in formative development
- **Integration Space**: Connections forming between discrete elements
- **Application Space**: Practical implementation of synthesized concepts
- **Foundation Space**: Established knowledge serving as building blocks

## State Transitions

Intelligence-augmented transitions enable content to evolve naturally through:

- **Pattern-Based Transitions**: Identifying optimal pathways based on content characteristics
- **Flow-Aware Timing**: Aligning transitions with optimal creative states
- **Relationship Preservation**: Maintaining connections across state changes
- **Evolution Tracking**: Preserving history through transition progression

## State Persistence

The persistence layer enables quantum states through:

- **Multi-State Content Model**: Files exist simultaneously across quantum states
- **Relationship-Aware Storage**: Content connections preserved through metadata
- **Transition Intelligence**: State changes trigger pattern recognition
- **Evolution Tracking**: Content history maintained through state progression
