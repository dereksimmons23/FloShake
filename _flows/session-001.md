# Flow Session 001: Quantum State Implementation

## Session Goals
- Set up quantum state directory structure
- Move existing content into appropriate states
- Create state layout templates
- Implement state visualization CSS

## Flow Interruptions
- None (isolated development session)

## Session Outcomes
- Created directory structure for four quantum states
- Developed state-specific CSS visualization
- Created state layout template
- Categorized existing content into appropriate states
- Documented the meta-process
- Prepared Agentic RAG exploration document
- Updated PROJECT_STATUS.md for Week 2

## State Transitions
- README.md from undefined to integration state
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md from undefined to application state
- Agentic-RAG concepts from undefined to creation state
- MODEL_CONTEXT_PROTOCOL.md added to creation state

## Final Flow State: engagement

## Notes for Next Session (Session 002)
- Complete Agentic RAG integration documentation
- Finalize Model Context Protocol documentation
- Create architecture diagrams for system components
- Implement state index pages for all quantum states
- Begin development of interactive visualization prototypes
