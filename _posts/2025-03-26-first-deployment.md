# FloShake: First Public Deployment

Today marks a significant milestone in the FloShake journey as we launch our public website and documentation framework. This deployment represents the transition from theoretical concept to tangible implementation.

## From Quantum Kitchen to FloShake

Originally conceived as "Quantum Kitchen," this project has evolved into FloShakeâ€”a framework that more precisely articulates our mission of blending human wisdom with AI to enhance creative flow. The name embodies our core philosophy: combining the right ingredients to achieve optimal results through the integration of human insight and artificial intelligence.

## Implementation Progress

The current deployment includes:
- Core conceptual framework documentation
- Initial system architecture specifications
- Development roadmap and milestone tracking
- Foundational technical specifications

## What's Next

In the coming weeks, we'll be expanding the documentation with:
- Detailed technical specifications for the Flow Protection Core
- Visual representations of the Quantum State Model
- Implementation examples for the Serendipity Engine
- API documentation for the Integration Framework

We invite you to follow our development journey as we build this transformative framework for intelligence-augmented creativity.
