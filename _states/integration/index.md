# Integration State

The Integration State represents connections forming between discrete elements where relationship patterns emerge and insights develop through cross-pollination. This space is designed for establishing relationships between components, documenting architectural frameworks, and mapping system interactions.

## Purpose

- Connect discrete concepts into coherent systems
- Establish relationships between components
- Document architectural frameworks and patterns
- Map dependencies and interactions between elements

## Current Integrations

Explore our current Integration State content:

- [FloShake Overview](/states/integration/readme-overview/)

## State Transition Criteria

Content transitions from Integration to Application when it:
- Has a complete implementation plan
- Contains sufficient detail for development
- Establishes clear interfaces with other components
- Has addressed major architectural questions

## Meta-Implementation

The Integration State itself is being built using FloShake principles:
- Connections are forming between core concepts
- Architecture documentation shows system relationships
- Component interactions are being mapped and defined
- Transition pathways are established to Application State
