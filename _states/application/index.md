# Application State

The Application State represents practical implementation of synthesized concepts where ideas transform into tangible value through structured development. This space contains working code, functional prototypes, and deployed documentation.

## Purpose

- House working implementations of concepts
- Store functional prototypes and demonstrations
- Maintain deployed documentation
- Preserve implementation examples and patterns

## Current Applications

Explore our current Application State content:

- [Implementation Plan](/states/application/implementation-plan/)

## State Transition Criteria

Content transitions from Application to Foundation when it:
- Has proven stable over time
- Serves as a building block for other components
- Follows established best practices
- Has been thoroughly tested and validated

## Meta-Implementation

The Application State itself is being built using FloShake principles:
- Implementation plans are being executed
- Prototypes are being developed for core concepts
- Documentation is being deployed for key components
- Transition criteria are being established for Foundation State
