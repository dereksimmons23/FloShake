# Foundation State

The Foundation State represents established knowledge serving as building blocks for new creation, forming the stable core that supports ongoing innovation. This space contains stable code, established assets, and core documentation.

## Purpose

- Establish foundational components
- Maintain stable code libraries
- Store core visual identity elements
- Preserve established documentation

## Current Foundations

The Foundation State is being established and will soon contain:

- Core visual identity elements
- Stable component implementations
- Fundamental documentation
- Reliable APIs and interfaces

## State Transition Criteria

Content transitions from Foundation to other states when:
- Major updates are required (moves to Application)
- Conceptual rethinking is needed (moves to Creation)
- Relationship restructuring is necessary (moves to Integration)

## Meta-Implementation

The Foundation State itself is being built using FloShake principles:
- Stable components are being established
- Core documentation is being finalized
- Visual identity elements are being standardized
- APIs and interfaces are being formalized
