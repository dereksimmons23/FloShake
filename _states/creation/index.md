# Creation State

The Creation State represents nascent ideas in formative development where creative flow requires maximum protection and exploration occurs without constraint. This space is designed for unstructured ideation, conceptual exploration, and early-stage development.

## Purpose

- House emerging concepts in their formative stage
- Protect the delicate early phases of ideation
- Enable unconstrained exploration without premature structure
- Establish the foundation for future development

## Current Explorations

Explore our current Creation State content:

- [Agentic RAG Integration](/states/creation/agentic-rag-exploration/)
- [Model Context Protocol](/states/creation/model-context-protocol/)

## State Transition Criteria

Content transitions from Creation to Integration when it:
- Forms clear connections with other components
- Establishes a defined role in the overall architecture
- Reaches sufficient maturity for implementation consideration
- Develops relationships with existing framework elements

## Meta-Implementation

The Creation State itself is being built using FloShake principles:
- Flow protection is applied during ideation sessions
- Concepts exist across multiple states simultaneously
- Relationships begin forming with other system components
- Documentation evolves through state transitions
