# Creation State

This directory contains initial concepts, explorations, and early-stage development artifacts.

## Purpose
- House nascent ideas in formative development
- Store design explorations and early prototypes
- Maintain experimental concepts that may evolve significantly

## When to use Creation State
- New feature ideation
- Visual design exploration
- Conceptual documentation drafts
- Experimental code that is not yet connected to other components

## Transition Criteria
Content moves from Creation to Integration when it:
- Forms clear connections with other components
- Establishes a defined role in the overall architecture
- Reaches sufficient maturity for implementation consideration
