# Agentic RAG Integration in FloShake

The integration of Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a significant enhancement to FloShake's intelligence-augmentation capabilities. This document explores how document agents and meta-agents operate within the quantum state framework to create a more sophisticated knowledge ecosystem.

## Agentic RAG Architecture

Traditional RAG systems connect LLMs with retrieved context to enhance responses. FloShake's Agentic RAG goes beyond by implementing a multi-agent architecture that maps directly to quantum states:
